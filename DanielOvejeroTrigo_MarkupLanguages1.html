                <p>This project consists on an XML file, with the XML schema and the transformation document to html.<br>
                It's the inforation about settings and preferences of five different users in a storage application. In this application,
                there are two kinds of accounts, accounts type "A" in which the user has social network and storage up until the amount of 
                data that it's set for each one of them or "B" that only permits the user to share information in social media.</p>
                <p>In the storage application the programming has been made differing between two bigger parts that are the information about the user
                and the account that has and another part that's oriented for the settings and preferences that this user will have in his
                account minding the position of the elements and the colours to display the interface.</p>

                    <h2 id="metho">Methodology</h2>
                    <p>The methodology used has followed the pattern of anidated tags with elements that contain other elements.<br>
                    This clasification is the one that most configuration pages have. It consists on a menu divided in some parts that have a certain
                    amount of elements. These are the tags that appear after "settings".<br> Then it's the tags the ones that can contain others,
                    that's because in the menu there are elements and options that are only reachable after clicking on the element.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>In this project we've made the xml anidating tags after tags basically creating 5 groups of tags in 2 big groups. Those
                        two big groups are the information part, where it's displayed the information about the user and the settings part where there
                        are all the preferences and conditions of the account the user has.<br>About the small groups, there are five small groups, one 
                        concerning identification, where we have all the information about the user, "account", which is the one where the information
                        regarding the kind of account the user has. These are the ones that are contained in "information".</p>
                    <p>
                        After this we have the groups of tags that are stored in settings, which are social settings, storagesettings, sendingsettings
                        and displaysettings.<br>Social settings take care of the information regarding who can watch and who cannot watch our users information.
                        <br> Storage settings control the formats, connections and formats that the storage can have, of course, if available. <br>
                        Sending Settings controls the connections between the email and notification to the user's phone.<br>
                        Display settings are the settings related to the information about how the user's interaction with the app is displayed. It shows 
                        where to put the information, colours and location of the different elements that are in a normal interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the information regarding the schema the used style is the russian doll design because it's the most clear one and the one that's
                        easier to understand from a readers point of view. <br> It's also more logical and easier to programme since it follows the same
                        order as in the xml declaration.</p>

                    <p>The project has been stored in the following GITHUB repository:</p>

                    </nav>
                    <p>This project was created as a HTML5 project and it has the files "project", "projectschema" and "project_transformation" inside the 
                    HTML5 folder.</p>
                    <p>The project file it's the XML with all the information that is used for the transformation. It has 50 elements, 12 attributes
                    and 5 different records.</p>
                    <p>In the projectschema file there's the schema of the XML file, done in a russian doll approach.</p>
                    <p>The project_transformation has the transformation of the XML into HTML. It's configured so it displays basic 
                    information about the user regarding its name, account number, phone, etc.</p>
                    <p>Finally there's this file where all the information about the project is stored and showed.</p>

                 <p>Regarding the transformation, it was done displaying very basic information about the user, mainly the name, the 
                 identification, how do the users pay and if the account is active and for how long.</p>
                 <p>The data is showed divided in two parts, the first one is the information regarding the names, contact, location and state of 
                 the account. The second part has the information related to the account number, the payments that are necessary for keeping
                 the account and the way the user pays for the account.</p>
                 <p>It also has a title that has the username of the user that comes from the attribute that was used to identify
                 every user in the transformation, and it's the element that defines the different users that we have.</p>

                 </header>
                 <p>During this project the elaboration of the XML was easy with all the knowledge that we got from the classes.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, the  most difficult part about this project has been the transformation, it had a lot of problems
                that were difficult to solve. In fact it was not possible to solve the last one that is that when displaying the information
                it displays the information about the first user 5 times when it should change but after much thinking and consulting online
                it was not possible to find a solution to that problem.</p>
                <p>The information regarding the database was an example I could think about, I'm not sure it was the best approach to the
                chosen topic but it definetly covers the concept of an application settings and preferences. Sometimes it was difficult
                to think about how many attributes could there be when coding about an app settings preferences and therefore there are
                some of them that can seem useless like the percentages of storage that are full when they give notice to the user.</p>
